# Decision Log Digest

Auto-generated consolidated rules from `docs/decisions/`. The agent
reads this at session start. Per-decision entries
(`docs/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`) are the human-facing reasoning. Refresh with:

Markers that surface as Critical: `**Always**`, `**Never**`, `**MUST**`.

## Critical

- **Always** include `PR <N>` in subject for non-trivial changes that belong to a logical series. _(from `2026-09-08-conventional-commits-and-cleanup-prs`)
- **Always** prefix commits with a type: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `docs:`. _(from `2026-09-08-conventional-commits-and-cleanup-prs`)
- **Never** use `fix:` for a pure refactor — `fix:` implies a bug was fixed; use `refactor:` for restructuring without behaviour change. _(from `2026-09-08-conventional-commits-and-cleanup-prs`)
- **Never** skip domain unit tests for "quick fixes" — the <1 s execution time makes it free to run. _(from `2026-09-08-domain-coverage-pr4`)
- New code in `domain/pipeline/**` **MUST** include a unit test in `domain/src/test/kotlin/` that uses `FakeSideInterpreterRegistry`. _(from `2026-09-08-domain-coverage-pr4`)
- **Always** use `SideInterpreterRegistry` to register all side-effect handlers before calling `Pipeline.run()`. _(from `2026-09-08-functional-pipeline-refactor`)
- **Never** call `delay()` or `UUID.randomUUID()` inside a `Stage` — inject timing/id generation through `PipelineContext` if needed. _(from `2026-09-08-functional-pipeline-refactor`)
- **Never** emit a `Side` from a stage without a corresponding interpreter registered — the pipeline will throw at runtime. _(from `2026-09-08-functional-pipeline-refactor`)
- New code in `domain/pipeline/**` **MUST** be accompanied by a pure-Kotlin test in `domain/src/test/kotlin/` using a fake registry. _(from `2026-09-08-functional-pipeline-refactor`)
- **Always** call `server.baseUrl()` inside the test lambda (not at class instantiation), because the port is assigned on `start()` _(from `2026-09-08-integration-testing-pr7`)
- **Always** emit `Step.Retry` from download stage for retryable errors — `Step.Fail` bypasses `stageWithRetry` _(from `2026-09-08-integration-testing-pr7`)
- **Always** use `jdbc:sqlite:file::memory:?cache=shared` for in-memory SQLite in tests _(from `2026-09-08-integration-testing-pr7`)
- **Never** use `Random.Default` in retry tests — use seeded `Random` for deterministic back-off _(from `2026-09-08-integration-testing-pr7`)
- **Always** use `NoRetryKtorDownloader` in integration tests that verify retry. _(from `2026-09-08-retry-semantics-pr8`)
- **Never** emit `Step.Fail` for a condition that should be retried — use _(from `2026-09-08-retry-semantics-pr8`)
- **Never** register a live side-effect interpreter that the pipeline never calls. _(from `2026-09-08-retry-semantics-pr8`)

## Per-tag

### `architecture`

- `DomainError` still has `isStopped()` / `isDrop()` defaults — zero callers confirmed, removal deferred _(from `2026-09-09-dead-code-purge-pr9`)_
- `Pipeline.run()` save-stage `when` is still exhaustive (added explicit `Cont` comment) _(from `2026-09-09-dead-code-purge-pr9`)_
- `SaveBatchInterpreter` and `ScheduleRetryInterpreter` are not optional — they must be registered in every `runTarget`. _(from `2026-09-08-functional-pipeline-refactor`)_
- `StageFailure` sealed interface now has 6 variants (was 7) _(from `2026-09-09-dead-code-purge-pr9`)_
